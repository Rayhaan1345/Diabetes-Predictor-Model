<h1> Hyperparameters tuning</h1>
I have adjusted the most important hyperparametrs for XGBoost:
1. Learning Rate(learning_rate)
2. Number of trees(n_estimators)
3. Treedepth(usually due to the dataset running low on data)(max_depth) 
4. The kind of XGB-you want to run, XGBClassifier or XGBRegressor
5. The Objective (classification, regression or logistic regression)

**Data Collection:**
As we discussed before, data is a pre-existing dataset from NHANES available on Kaggle.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
I took the dataset and filled in the missing values(very few) with means of the whole columns.

**Deplyoment:**
The web app is hosted on streamlit, and online for people to use.

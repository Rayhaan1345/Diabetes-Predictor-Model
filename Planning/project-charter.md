**Problem:**
Today, it seems as if the word “Diabetes” is almost everywhere, from doctors to pharmaceutical advertisements. But have you ever wondered what it is really? Diabetes, as described by the World Health Organization (WHO), Is a condition, where the pancreas in our body fails to produce sufficient quantities of insulin, the hormone which is responsible for the breakdown of glucose (sugars a person consumes):
Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.
People with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, starstruck, and kidney failure. Diabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyes. In some severe cases, people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow. This can cause foot ulcers and may
lead to amputation.
Around the world, according to the last 2019 report by WHO, it is estimated that 422 million individuals are suffering from diabetes. 21.1 million of them suffer from type-1 diabetes and the rest suffer from type-2 diabetes. Through recent studies, it is estimated that the number of people suffering from diabetes is projected to grow to 783 million in
2045.

By looking at the graph above, it is clear that the number of people with diabetes is increasing. And it is a worrying trend, because it is estimated that each year around 1.5 million people (about the population of Nebraska) die directly due to diabetes. [4]
This increase can be largely attributed to people nowadays living a more sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy eating habits which include excessive sugar consumption, and sodium consumption. [5]
But, before someone becomes a diabetic, they pass through it a phase called the pre- diabetes stage which as the name suggests occurs just before type-2 diabetes. In this phase, an individual can come out of the diabetic spectrum before they become diabetic. By having a healthy lifestyle, getting frequent exercise, and sleeping well.
*The main purpose of me creating this ML powered web app is to identify the prediabetics in this crucial stage before they permanently enter the diabetic spectrum.*

<h1>*Now the main part- training the model.</h1>

In this folder- I will be uploading the trained model in a `.pkl` file, uploading the `.ipnyb` (iPython Notebook) used for training, testing and exporting the model, and finally the predicted `.csv` 
file of the predictions made by the model on the training set.
